# Full-Stack Web Applications Using MERN

This repository showcases my experience in developing full-stack web applications using modern web technologies, demonstrating proficiency in both front-end and back-end development.  I've successfully implemented secure user authentication, efficient data handling, and responsive design, with a focus on user experience and performance.

## Technologies Used

### Back-End
- **Node.js**: Server-side runtime for building scalable and efficient applications.
- **Express.js**: Minimalist web framework for routing and handling HTTP requests.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for efficient data storage and management.
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Managed cloud service for MongoDB, enabling easy database hosting and scaling.
- **Passport.js**: Authentication middleware for implementing secure login systems.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Stateless authentication method for secure user login and session management.
- **Joi**: Schema validation library for ensuring proper input validation across the application.
- **Multer**: Middleware for handling file uploads, enabling users to submit images and other media files.
- **Cloudinary**: Image and video management platform for handling file storage, optimization, and delivery.
- **RESTful APIs**: Built REST APIs for managing back-end operations, facilitating smooth communication between front-end and back-end.

### Front-End
- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces, enhancing user experience with dynamic content updates.
- **Material-UI**: Popular React UI framework used for designing modern, responsive interfaces with pre-built components.
- **Bootstrap**: Front-end framework for creating mobile-first, responsive websites with a grid system and reusable components.
- **CSS**: Custom styling for tailoring the user interface to meet the design requirements.
- **EJS**: Templating engine used for rendering dynamic HTML pages on the server-side.
- **React Router**: Enables navigation between different views and sections of the application, ensuring smooth transitions and client-side routing.



## Key Features

- **Secure User Authentication**: Implemented Passport.js with JWT for handling user registration, login, and session management, ensuring only authorized access to the application.
- **CRUD Operations**: Users can create, read, update, and delete their data with strict role-based access control to ensure privacy and data integrity.
- **Responsive Design**: Used Bootstrap and custom CSS to ensure that the application is fully responsive and accessible across all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
- **File Handling**: Integrated Multer for handling file uploads with Cloudinary for image and file storage and optimization.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Implemented user-specific dashboards for displaying and managing data in real-time, allowing users to interact with the app seamlessly.
- **Real-Time Data**: Integrated external APIs to fetch real-time data, keeping the application up to date and interactive.
- **user-specific Permissions**: Allowed only authorized users to perform sensitive operations, such as editing listings or placing stock orders, to ensure privacy and security.
