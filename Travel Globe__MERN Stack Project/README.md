 Developed a full-stack web application using MVC architecture with secure user authentication, CRUD operations, 
and session management, included Passport.js, Joi, Multer, and Cloudinary for security, validation, and file 
handling. Utilized MongoDB for data storage, Bootstrap for a responsive design, and EJS for templating. 

 Enabled users to browse and explore destinations with detailed descriptions, interactive maps via Mapbox, and 
image galleries. Implemented user-specific permissions to allow only owners to edit their listings, ensuring privacy.
